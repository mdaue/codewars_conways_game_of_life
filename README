# Codewars - Conways Game Of Life

Solution contained is original.

The rules of the game are:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

Each cell's neighborhood is the 8 cells immediately around it (i.e. Moore Neighborhood). The universe is infinite in both the x and y dimensions and all cells are initially dead - except for those specified in the arguments.
